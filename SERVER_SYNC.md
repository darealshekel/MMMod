# MMM Server Sync

`server-sync` is a separate server-side Fabric module for authoritative MMM website sync.
It works fully server-side. Players do not need to install MMMod on their client for server leaderboard totals, server-side block breakdowns, or server-side last-mined timestamps to sync.

It is intentionally separate from the normal client MMMod:

- Client MMMod sends sessions, local block breakdowns, HUD stats, visible scoreboard scans, and readable totals as evidence.
- Server Sync sends authoritative source leaderboards, server totals, per-player block breakdowns, and last mined timestamps.
- The website API only treats `sync_origin: "server_authoritative"` payloads from approved server installs as trusted public source leaderboard updates.

## Build

From the `MMMod` repo:

```bash
gradle build
```

The 1.21.6 server jar is created at:

```text
server-sync/build/libs/mmm-server-sync-<version>.jar
```

The 1.21.4 server jar is created at:

```text
server-sync-1.21.4/build/libs/mmm-server-sync-1.21.4-<version>+1.21.4.jar
```

## Server Config

On first launch, the mod writes:

```text
config/mmm-server-sync.json
```

Important fields:

- `enabled`: defaults to `true`.
- `endpoint`: defaults to `https://sync.mmmaniacs.com/v1/sync`.
- `sourceName`: optional source/server name shown on MMM. If empty, the server MOTD is used.
- `sourceKey`: optional stable source key. If empty, it is generated from `sourceName`.
- `syncIntervalSeconds`: default `86400` (24 hours).

Server owners do not need the website's shared sync secret. The first successful sync registers the server install as pending in MMM Source Moderation. An owner approves the source there; after approval, that server install can publish trusted server leaderboard rows.

The unique per-install ID and token are generated in:

```text
config/mmm-server-sync-credentials.json
```

This credential only authorizes that one server installation. The jar contains no MMM shared secret, database password, VPS credential, or owner token. On POSIX filesystems, the credential file is written with owner-only permissions. Deleting it creates a new installation identity that must be approved again.

Pending installs check for approval every five minutes. Approved installs publish one complete authoritative snapshot every 24 hours. The last successful sync and next attempt are persisted in `mmm-server-sync-state.json`, so restarting the Minecraft server does not bypass the daily interval. Failed requests retry with bounded backoff without advancing the successful daily schedule.

## What It Syncs

- Total source leaderboard from a total/digs/mined-blocks scoreboard objective when available.
- If no total objective exists, it combines pickaxe, shovel, and axe use scoreboard objectives.
- If no matching scoreboard objectives exist, it falls back to server-side valid block-break events tracked after the server mod was installed.
- Per-player block breakdown for MMM's allowed block breakdown catalog.
- Per-player `last_mined_at` when the player actually mined a valid block.

The fallback state is stored in:

```text
config/mmm-server-sync-state.json
```

Do not delete that file unless you want to reset server-side fallback tracking.
